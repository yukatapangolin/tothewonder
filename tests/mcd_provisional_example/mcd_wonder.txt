Caveats:
"1. Data are Suppressed when the data meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Assurance of Confidentiality."
"2. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated."
"3. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Not Stated."
"4. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/mcd-provisional.html#Racial Differences."
"5. The population figures for years 2021 and 2020 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage"
"2020 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on July 27, 2021. The population figures for year 2019 are single-race"
"estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2019 postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 25,"
"2020. The population figures for year 2018 are single-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2018"
"postcensal series released by the Census Bureau on June 20, 2019."
"6. Between December 22, 2020 and February 3, 2021, the county-level race-specific population figures and rates reported for year"
"2018 were inaccurate for queries that reported race-specific categories for single race 6 Race groups in combination for any"
"specific County and/or Urbanization categories. The results to such queries erroneously reported inaccurate population values"
"and death rates for specific 6 Race categories at the county level. This problem applied to all queries with County and/or"
"Urbanization categories and the specific 6 Race categories in year 2018. We apologize for this error."
"7. Deaths occurring through May 21, 2022 as of June 05, 2022."
